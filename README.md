# Anti-Hype

This is a browser extension for reducing hyped-up tech buzzwords to roughly equivalent (though much less exciting) descriptions.

I don't recommend actually running this full-time, as it may cause confusion, but it is fun to run for a bit.

Hopefully this extension can bring you some entertainment, as well as providing a bit of educational value.

This is based on Cynthia Bailey Lee's [blockchain-to-spreadsheet](https://github.com/cynthiablee/blockchain-to-spreadsheet) extension.

List of replacements (which may come in a few forms, to adapt for grammar):

* blockchain -> multiple copies of a giant Excel spreadsheet
* artificial intelligence -> statistics models too complicated for their developers to explain
* the cloud -> a computer that isn't yours
* cloud computing -> asking someone else to run your program for you

## Installing

### Firefox

When I get a chance, I'll submit this to AMO.

### Chrome

I have no plans at this time to add this to the Chrome Web Store, but if you want to, you're welcome to.

I have retained these instructions from [blockchain-to-spreadsheet](https://github.com/cynthiablee/blockchain-to-spreadsheet)'s README:

Or you can do a manual install from this GitHub repo (also easy!) by following these steps:

* Note: enabling "developer mode" extensions in your browser--as needed for manual install--is risky. Chrome may remind you to be worried about that. To avoid those pop-up warnings, use the official Chrome store install above instead of this manual install.

1. Download this git repository to your computer by clicking "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP." 
2. Unzip/extract the ZIP on your computer.
3. Go to this URL in your Chrome browser: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click to check the box for "Developer mode."
5. One of the new buttons that should appear is "Load unpacked extension." Click it. 
6. Choose the folder that the unzipped/extracted files are in (probably called "blockchain-to-spreadsheet-master").
7. The extension should now appear and the "Enabled" box should be checked. Start browsing blockchain news to read about all the things a giant Excel spreadsheet can do!

## Contributing

If you have a buzzword you want to contribute an alternative phrase for, feel free to submit a pull request (or just open an issue).

## Special thanks

Big thanks to Cynthia Bailey Lee for making the [blockchain-to-spreadsheet](https://github.com/cynthiablee/blockchain-to-spreadsheet) extension that brought me a lot of joy and inspired this one!

Twitter user @mims (Christopher Mims) for [the suggestion](https://twitter.com/mims/status/968967786130300928) to make a "browser extension that replaces "blockchain" with "multiple copies of a giant Excel spreadsheet." For example, "multiple copies of a giant excel spreadsheet to revolutionize journalism." 

Thanks to Tom Maxwell for the [tutorial and template code](https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/) for this project!
